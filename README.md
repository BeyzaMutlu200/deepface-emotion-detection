# Emotion Detection with DeepFace and OpenCV

## Description
This script uses DeepFace and OpenCV to detect faces and their dominant emotions in real-time from a webcam feed. It draws rectangles around detected faces and displays the predicted emotion above each face.

## File
- `facial_expression.py` : Real-time emotion detection via webcam.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- DeepFace (`deepface`)
- Haarcascade XML file: `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`

## Usage
1. Make sure your webcam is connected.
2. Run the script:
